# Konduit webpage

This is the repository for the main Konduit site. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) is the frontend framework, which is react based. It's created using a combination of static site generation for the public facing pages with [sanity.io](https://sanity.io) as the cms, as well as client side logic and data fetching on the protected profile pages.

Authentification is handled with [Auth0](https://auth0.com), and the API used for data fetching and mutation is found in the [backend repository](https://github.com/stiftelsen-effekt/effekt-backend).
